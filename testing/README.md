# testing
this subdirectory contains various tests for the antisocial server to ensure its proper and correct operation.

## installation
first, you need a proper `config.json` file with the same format as the one for the server and a `localstorage.json` file (it should just be `{}`). then, you can `npm i` and you're good to go.
